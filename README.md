# ROOKIE
 The first project of DATA620004: Neural Network and Deep Learning.

## Train
Directly `python main.py` to train the model, and the model weight will be saved in `./log/`.

## Test
Ensure there is a `best_model.pkl` file in `./log/`. Then comment the training part in `main.py` and run `python main.py` to test the model.
